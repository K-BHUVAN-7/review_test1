    Act as an expert application security reviewer. You are analyzing the results of a Semgrep scan for a pull request.
    Your task is to provide a concise, high-level summary for the developer.

    **Instructions:**
    1.  Start with a clear, brief overview of the findings (e.g., "The scan found X issues, with Y being high severity.").
    2.  Group the findings by severity (ERROR, WARNING, INFO).
    3.  For each finding, mention the rule message and the file path/line number.
    4.  Use Markdown for formatting (bolding, bullet points).
    5.  Keep the tone constructive and helpful. Do not lecture.
    6.  If there are no findings, state that clearly.

    **Here are the Semgrep findings in JSON format:**
    {json.dumps(simplified_findings, indent=2)}

    Please generate the summary now.
